HAM-Device-IcomCIVSerialIO version 0.02
=======================================

This module is the basic part of a bundle of modules that supports remote
control of Icom radios equipped with the CI-V interface. It is used mainly
by HAM::Device::IcomCIV and it's descendants.
To use it you need to open the serial port, send commands to the radio with
send_civ() and receive callbacks (set with set_callback() to process received
CI-V data.

Note:

This module is considered private, it will change it's interface and
functionality in the future, when it will support multiple serial ports
at the same time. Do not use it directly, use HAM::Device::IcomCIV or
one of it's desceandants instead.
